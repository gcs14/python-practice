# write a paragraph about the game explaining the idea of it

”Aliens have invaded a space ship and our hero has to go through a maze of rooms defeating them so
he can escape into an escape pod to the planet below. The game will be more like a Zork or Adventure
type game with text outputs and funny ways to die. The game will involve an engine that runs a map
full of rooms or scenes. Each room will print its own description when the player enters it and then tell
the engine what room to run next out of the map.”

# write out and describe each scence
Death - This is when the player dies and should be something funny.

Central Corridor - This is the starting point and has a Gothon already standing there that the players have
to defeat with a joke before continuing.

Laser Weapon Armory - This is where the hero gets a neutron bomb to blow up the ship before getting
to the escape pod. It has a keypad the hero has to guess the number for.

The Bridge - Another battle scene with a Gothon where the hero places the bomb.

Escape Pod - Where the hero escapes but only after guessing the right escape pod.
